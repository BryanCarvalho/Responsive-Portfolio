                    John Fleming Churchill (1829–1894), served in the Ceylon Civil Service. Soon after Churchill's birth,
                    the family returned to Surrey, where his younger brother, Thomas Bell Lindsay Churchill, was born (in
                    1907). In 1910, the Churchills moved to Hong Kong when Alec Fleming Churchill was appointed as Director
                    of Public Works in Hong Kong. The Churchills' third and youngest son, Robert Alec Farquar Churchill,
                    was born in Hong Kong in 1911. The family returned to England in 1917.

                    Churchill left the army in 1936 and worked as a newspaper editor in Nairobi, Kenya, and as a male model. He used his archery
                    and bagpipe talents to play a small role in the 1924 film, The Thief of Bagdad and also appeared in the
                    1938 film, A Yank at Oxford. He took second place in the 1938 military piping competition at the Aldershot
                    Tattoo. In 1939, he represented Great Britain at the World Archery Championships in Oslo.
