                    As soon as he could hold a pencil he loved to create. The alure of a blank page opened up a world of possibilities. Strangely
                    enough, Bryan initially began his academic career at York University studying political science. After
                    his time at York, he decided to pursue a creative path in graphic design at Seneca College. Finding his
                    stride, he began to win a number of notable awards and saw his work published during his time at Seneca.
                    Completing an internship and subsequent freelance work with prestigious design firm, 'Bruce Mau', Bryan
                    worked with brands such as General Electric, Louboutin, K11, and Design Exchange. His work can be seen
                    in Canada, Hong Kong, and Indonesia.
